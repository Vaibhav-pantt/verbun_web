      <div class="timeline-text">
    <h3>Jōmon Period (14,000–300 BCE)</h3>
<p>
  The Jōmon Period is Japan's earliest known prehistoric culture, distinguished by its unique pottery with cord-marked patterns, from which its name derives ("Jōmon" means "cord pattern").  
</p>
<p>
  During this era, people lived mostly as hunter-gatherers and fishermen, adopting a semi-nomadic lifestyle. They crafted stone tools and engaged in early forms of ritualistic and spiritual practices, which are reflected in clay figurines called "dogū."
</p>
<p>
  The period laid the foundational cultural and technological developments that would influence later Japanese civilizations.

      <div class="timeline-text">
    <h3>Heian Period (794–1185)</h3>
<p>
  The Heian Period marks a golden age of classical Japanese culture, characterized by a flourishing court life centered in the capital, Heian-kyō (modern-day Kyoto).  
</p>
<p>
  This era is renowned for its developments in poetry, art, and literature, highlighted by the creation of <em>The Tale of Genji</em> by Murasaki Shikibu, often considered the world’s first novel.  
</p>
<p>
  The period saw the rise of refined aesthetics, the growth of aristocratic influence, and the beginnings of the samurai class that would shape later Japanese history.

      <div class="timeline-text">
    <h3>Samurai & Feudal Era (1185–1600)</h3>
<p>
  This era witnessed the rise of the samurai warrior class and the establishment of the shogunate system, where military leaders ruled Japan under the emperor’s nominal authority.
</p>
<p>
  Marked by periods of both stability and intense internal conflict—especially during the Sengoku, or “Warring States,” period—this time saw samurai clans battling for power, shaping Japan’s political landscape.
</p>
<p>
  The code of bushidō, emphasizing loyalty, honor, and martial skill, became deeply ingrained, influencing Japanese culture and values for centuries to come.

      <div class="timeline-text">
     <h3>Edo Period (1603–1868)</h3>
<p>
  The Edo Period, also known as the Tokugawa Period, was a time of peace, stability, and isolation under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate. The shoguns centralized power and maintained strict social order, creating a rigid class hierarchy with the samurai, farmers, artisans, and merchants.
</p>

<p>
  Edo (modern-day Tokyo) became one of the largest cities in the world, with a booming merchant class and vibrant entertainment districts. Education and literacy rates increased
</p>
<p>
  This era laid the foundations of modern Japan, preserving cultural identity while sowing the seeds of modernization that would explode during the Meiji Restoration.

    <h3>Meiji Restoration (1868–1912)</h3>
<p>
  The Meiji Restoration marked the end of over two centuries of feudal rule by the Tokugawa shogunate and restored power to the Emperor of Japan. This era began with Emperor Meiji's ascension in 1868 and initiated a period of profound political, economic, and social change.
</p>
<p>
  Japan rapidly modernized by adopting Western technology, education systems, military organization, and industrial practices. Railways, telegraphs, and factories sprang up, and a modern conscripted army replaced the samurai class.

    <h3>Post-War Japan & Recovery (1945–Present)</h3>
<p>
  After the devastation of World War II, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan faced massive challenges in rebuilding. Under U.S. occupation, Japan adopted a new pacifist constitution, demilitarized, and underwent land, political, and educational reforms.
</p>
<p>
  The 1950s to 1970s saw the “Japanese Economic Miracle,” where Japan rapidly industrialized and became one of the world’s leading economies, driven by innovation in automotive and electronics industries. Cities like Tokyo transformed into modern metropolises.

  <div class="timeline-text">
  <h3>Ninja & Espionage (15th–17th Century)</h3>
<p>
  Ninjas, or shinobi, were covert operatives specializing in espionage, sabotage, guerrilla warfare, and assassination during Japan’s feudal conflicts. Unlike the samurai, who fought openly, ninjas operated in secrecy, gathering intelligence and performing missions that required stealth and cunning.
</p>
<p>
  Their skills in disguise, infiltration, and unconventional tactics made them invaluable during the turbulent Sengoku period, shaping many outcomes from the shadows and leaving a lasting legacy in Japanese folklore and popular culture.
